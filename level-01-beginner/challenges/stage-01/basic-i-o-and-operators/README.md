## Introduction

Before diving into hands-on coding challenges, it's crucial to understand the core building blocks of C++:

- [Structure of a C++ Program](https://github.com/darkscriptstudio/cpp-zero-to-hero-challenges/blob/main/level-01-beginner/docs/README.md)
- [Input & Output](https://github.com/darkscriptstudio/cpp-zero-to-hero-challenges/blob/main/level-01-beginner/docs/input-output.md)
- [Variables & Data Types](https://github.com/darkscriptstudio/cpp-zero-to-hero-challenges/blob/main/level-01-beginner/docs/variable-and-data-types.md)
- [Operators](https://github.com/darkscriptstudio/cpp-zero-to-hero-challenges/blob/main/level-01-beginner/docs/operators.md)

> Note: If you're new to these concepts, we strongly recommend starting from the documentation above to build a solid foundation. - [Start Learning Now](https://github.com/darkscriptstudio/cpp-zero-to-hero-challenges/blob/main/level-01-beginner/docs/README.md)
