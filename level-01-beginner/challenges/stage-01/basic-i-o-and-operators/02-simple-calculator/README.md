## Challenge 02: Simple Calculator

**Difficulty**: Easy

**Category**: Input/Output, Arithmetic Operators


---

## Problem Description
Build a simple calculator in C++ that can perform four basic arithmetic operations:
- ðŸ”¹ Input: Two numbers (e.g. `10`, `5`)
- ðŸ”¹ Output:
```bash
sum = 15
min = 5
mul = 50
div = 2
mod = 0
// display it in a structured format
```

## What should you think about?
- How to take two inputs
- How to declare and use variables
- How to use oporetors
- How to show it in a structured formet

---

## Explore Concepts Involved
- Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Input/Output syntax (`cin`, `cout`)
- Possibly floating point numbers (use `float` or `double`)
