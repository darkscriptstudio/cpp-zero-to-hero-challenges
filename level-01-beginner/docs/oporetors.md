## 1. Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Meaning        | Example        | Output |
|----------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| `+`      | Addition       | `5 + 3`        | `8`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction    | `10 - 6`       | `4`    |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `4 * 2`        | `8`    |
| `/`      | Division       | `8 / 2`        | `4`    |
| `%`      | Modulus        | `7 % 3`        | `1`    |

### Example uses:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 3;
    cout << "a + b = " << a + b << endl;
    cout << "a - b = " << a - b << endl;
    cout << "a * b = " << a * b << endl;
    cout << "a / b = " << a / b << endl;
    cout << "a % b = " << a % b << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```bash
a + b = 13
a - b = 7
a * b = 30
a / b = 3.33333333
a % b = 1
```

## 2. Relational (Comparison) Operators

Used to compare values. Always returns `true` (`1`) or `false` (`0`).

| Operator | Meaning	         | Example | Result |
|--------- |---------------------|---------|--------|
| ==	   | Equal to	         | 5 == 5  | true   |
| !=	   | Not equal to	     | 3 != 4  | true   |
| <	       | Less than	         | 2 < 5   | true   |
| >	       | Greater than	     | 6 > 2   | true   |
| <=	   | Less than or equal	 | 5 <= 5  | true   |
| >=	   | Greater or equal	 | 3 >= 4  | false  |

```cpp
int x = 5, y = 10;
cout << (x < y) << endl;    // Outputs 1 (true)
cout << (x == y) << endl;   // Outputs 0 (false)
```

## 3. Logical Operators

Used to combine conditions.

| Operator | Name |	Meaning                 |
|----------|------|-------------------------|
| &&	   | AND  |	True if both are true   |
| ||	   | OR   | True if one are true    |
| !	       | NOT  |	Inverts the condition   |

```
int age = 20;
bool hasID = true;

if (age >= 18 && hasID) { // check age is getter then or equal 18 and hasId = true
    cout << "You are allowed!" << endl;
}
```

> Note: You will only understand the operator `if` condition is taught to you in the next lesson.

## Real Life Example

### Traffic Light:
- greenLight `==` `true` `&&` roadClear `==` `true` ‚Üí GO
- greenLight `==` `false` `||` roadBlocked `==` `true` ‚Üí STOP


### Just like in code:
```cpp
if (greenLight && !roadBlocked) { // check greenLight == True and not roadBlocked (not false)
    cout << "Drive forward." << endl; // If both condition are true show "Drive forward"
} 
```

## Final Words from Mohammad Tanvir
